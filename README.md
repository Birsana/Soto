This was my very first iOS project, where I attempted to learn Swift while also completing a very amibitious project. As a result, there is a tremendous amount of spaghetti code in here, as well as a multitude of terrible Swift coding practices that make me cringe everytime I look back at this code. I even considered going back and rewriting this app, but my lack of commenting (what was I thinking) means that this would take way too long to be remotely feasible. 

However, this app does have some pretty cool features that I managed to implement:
-create a unique account with email and username
-search for and add users as friends
-send photos on camera roll to friends, or create albums that friends can contribute to
-notification when sending a photo to someone
-take photos within the app that are saved to camera roll
-can detect if photo taken contains friend, and send it to them
